# POSCAR
Implemented NVIDIA DOPE algorithm on CPU to implement a bin picking algorithm. 

The following additional folders also need to be installed (cloned):
Universal_Robots_Ros Driver: https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver/tree/16292b167108f33cfa93797bcb35c699431766ee
Universal Robot: https://github.com/fmauch/universal_robot/tree/90c141b4719dd0df87baef12c46c26c374608ba1

The following programs must be installed:
git
ros-melodic
MoveIt
pytorch (cpu version)
python-pip
NVidis CUDA toolkit

This repo is for a project for the course Robot Perception, at NYU. 
The repositories used to implement this project are yet to be ackowledged. The author and co-auther of this project do not take complete credit for the work in this repo, since it was built of off a few exsisting Open-source repositories (NVIDIA DOPE, and TriplSBin picking).
